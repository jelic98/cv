Android application for a system used by [Wiener Städtische](https://wiener.co.rs) to prevent vehicle insurance scams.
The client receives configuration from the server and while the user is filling up a form, it reads inputs from various sensors to determine the surrounding environment.
The client then sends sensor data along with multimedia and form data to the central server for entity matching and policy analysis.
The solution needed to be secure and reliable.

Minimal UI with bigger buttons and less text makes this solution suitable for drivers.
