Lead Android developer on [ZigSafe](http://app.zigsafe.com) project. Understanding business landscape. Working in a small team with PM, designer, tester and backend developer. Biggest challenges are preventing security threats and changing UI based on configuration JSON downloaded after login and because of this I’ve developed [Dynamico](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/6926) library and open sourced it. This is when I first fell in love with clean code.
