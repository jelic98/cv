## Experience

### Faculty of Computing

### DZOKS
__Founder__
`Sep 2018 - Now`

Founded a company for designing and selling clothing popular among young Balkan population.
One of the reasons for starting this journey is to generate passive income.
Decided to automate most of the processes of e-commerce.
For that purposes, cracked the official [Post of Serbia’s application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rs.assecosee.pttandroidapp) and got access to private API which is then used to ship the package at the click of a button.
Since the beginning, gained experience in building brand awareness with a small budget and customer interaction.
The biggest challenge is time and resource management.

### Fintech M4 Pro
__Android Developer__
`Sep 2016 - Now`

Acquired to improve the architecture of [ZigSafe](https://app.zigsafe.com) application and push it to the production.
As I was building the product, I was getting more attached to it and got to know the business landscape.
That lead me to propose some useful features which were later implemented.
Apart from me, the team has a PM, designer and a backend developer.
The biggest challenges are preventing security threats and enabling dynamic application behaviour.
Because of this I’ve developed [Dynamico](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/6926) library and open-sourced it.

### Freelance

Portfolio is available at [lazarjelic.com/ecloga](https://lazarjelic.com/ecloga).

## Projects

### ZigSafe
__Android__
`Sep 2016 - Now`

Android application for a system used by [Wiener Städtische](https://wiener.co.rs) to prevent vehicle insurance scams.
The client receives configuration from the server and while the user is filling up a form, it reads inputs from various sensors to determine the surrounding environment.
The client then sends sensor data along with multimedia and form data to the central server for entity matching and policy analysis.
The solution needed to be secure and reliable.
Project is part of the [Microsoft BizSpark](https://startups.microsoft.com) program.

### ParkirajMe
__Android__
`Dec 2017 - Now`

Android application that allows users to be notified in real-time about an available parking place near them.
Minimal UI with bigger buttons and less text makes this solution suitable for drivers.
Also, this application is made for traffic wardens to help them easily check illegally parked vehicles.
Currently, this system is being implemented in the city of [Novi Sad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad).

[Available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synvolt.parkirajme)

__PHP__
`Jan 2018 - Sep 2018`

E-commerce platform with advanced admin panel functionalities including newsletter system, invoice and coupon generator, product warehouse with detailed statistics, real-time notifications, accepting Bitcoin and PayPal payments, etc.
The platform was built with the idea of reusability in mind and this solution can easily be used by other retailers.

### Rafpored
__Flutter__
`May 2018`

Flutter pilot project started for faculty's internal contest for the best application for showing news, scheduled exams and lectures at faculty.
This solution was the only one that can run on iOS devices.
Why?
Because a high percentage of students had iPhones, decided to build a solution that can be used by the majority of students, although I had plenty of experience in Android.
